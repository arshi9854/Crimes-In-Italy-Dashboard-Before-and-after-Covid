# Crimes-In-Italy-Dashboard-Before-and-after-Covid
To leverage ML and AI tools to further our understanding of Covid-19’s effects on crime. This would include both the “short-term” and “long-term” effects that might not be fully understood to this day. As such, problems to be addressed may include the following:

- Have, e.g., lockdowns reduced or increased crime rates overall?
- In which areas and regions have these changes proved most dramatic?
- Have certain specific types of crimes narrowed in frequency while others (such as domestic violence) have spread further both at the time of the pandemic and to date?
- How has the “geography” of crime changed overall?
- What specific factors, if any, can we isolate that explain these changes?
- Are there significant differences in how they have affected urban rather than rural areas?
- What can we predict about these trends in the near- and medium term?
